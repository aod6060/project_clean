For now and until I get to the point of beta and release of this project I won't be allowing contributions because
this project isn't at the point were I can validate bringing anyone on but during beta and release I'll revises this to allow for 
others to contribute. I just want to make I see through my vision of this project before I let someone else in because by
that time I will have the final product almost finished and I'll be doing mostly bug fixes and I'll be needing help because
I'm predicting the code base will be quite large by that time. Please be patient I just want to solo this project for a bit.

Also if you want to clone the project just follow what is in the LICENSE.md file.
