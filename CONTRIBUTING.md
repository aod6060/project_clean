For now I will not allow contribution until I'm in either beta and release. My goal right now is to see through my
vision and get a game developed after games are creative pursuit. Don't worry though by the time I hit beta I will
have most of my vision feature complete and I'll consider features from contributers and I'll revise this document.
The reason is really simple... I just want to focus and make sure my vision for this project is created first before
I add extra features. I want to make sure the core is good before I layer it extra.

Now you can ask questions if you want to you can just add an. Here some guide lines to follow...

* Please keep the questions about "Project Clean" so keep the question in context of the project.

* Please act as if your talking to a coworker at your job so no personal questions or anything you might get sent to HR for becuase I won't be asking you any of those questions either.

* Please do not ask questions about religion, politics, ideologies, or any topic that could be considered a taboo topic because at the very minimum I'll simply delete your question or at worse I might have to report you to github.com or to the higher authorities depending on how taboo the topic is. Plus I'm not going to talk about these topics either just the game itself will be discussed.

* If your new to programming and your looking for a mentor then sorry I don't have time. I have a full time job which takes up 40 hours of my time and this project which is another full time job. I will try and give you some sources but that is the best I can do right now given my time constraints.

* If you want to contribute then please be patient. I want to make sure the core of this game aka "Project Clean" is feature complete before I will consider additions. I am listening but until I get into beta I won't consider anything. Please be patient I will consider your contribution down the line.

These are just a few guide lines to follow when ask a simple question. I'm also expecting you to follow github.com anti-harasment guide lines as well. Just keep it clean and act like an adult because I'll be treating you like one. I'll also post a template for questions as well. Well see yall.


Also if you want to clone the project just follow what is in the LICENSE.md file.
