# Project Clean

Project Clean is a pick-n-sticks clone that I'll be working on for the
next few months. Its a simple 3D game were you goal is to clean up
that der yard. The yard is covered in sticks, trash bags, tvs, engines,
and a suprise crate. The goal of this game for me is to relearn by doing
a simple game so I can make a more complex game later on with the same 
technology stack which is as follows...

* SDL2 + extensions (SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf)
* OpenGL 4.* (Graphics)
* Bullet Physics 3 (Physics)
* FMOD (AudioFX and Music)
* Assimp 5 (Asset Loading but I might cosider create a tool)
* jsoncpp (config, maps, and other type of data the game needs)
* lua (scripting)
* glm (teh maths)

For anyone wonder yes I'm not going to use Unity5 or Unreal 4 engines for
creating this game. Any tool I need will be writen by me for this project
and the reason is simple... Educational. That being said I hope yall gain
something from this as much as I will. 

If you want to follow the project I do post videos on both YouTube and BitChute
were I'll be posting DevLog/Updates for this game. I also have other older
content as well if you want to watch.
